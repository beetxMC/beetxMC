# About Me

- I'm currently trying to learn how to code Jave through making my own Minecraft utility mod made for anarchy servers (https://github.com/kusakiDEV/kusakiMOD).
- It may seem childish, but I enjoy building and creating things in Minecraft and Roblox
- I like Nintendo's games, but not the company itself #freemelee
